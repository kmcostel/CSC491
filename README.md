##Senior Project

### Carb Counter!
This web application is a general use tool that allows anyone to find out the nutritional content of food. Diabetics are able to
specify their insulin needs, and then this app will report the amount of insulin needed for their current meal! A goal of this project
is to gain familiarity with a web tech stack (this includes Facebook's React, node + express). This project will be awesome.

###Setup steps
1. Clone the directory.
2. Run 'npm install' in Source folder (this is where package.json lives).
3. Create an appId and appKey with Nutritionix's developer API [website](https://developer.nutritionix.com/signup).
4. Open 'keys_ex.js' in your editor. Fill in your appId and appKey. Rename the file to 'keys.js'.

###Run Instructions
1. Run 'npm start' inside of the 'Source' folder.
2. Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
